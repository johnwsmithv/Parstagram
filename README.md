# Parstagram
## Week 5
This week we started building the Parstagram App, modeled off Instagramm, but not using their API. We are using Parse, back4app.com.

This week I was able to successfully implement the following: creating a user, signing up, signing in with an existing user, loading previous posts, refresh scroll, being able to post and being able to logout sucessfully.
